# Welcome to Flutter Color VS Code Extension 🎨✨

A user-friendly plugin to help you visualize the colors used in your project. Initially developed for Flutter, it is now used in various programming languages. It automatically parses and converts your color code into a small color picker box, allowing you to see and change the color as desired.

<br/>

Dear All,<br/>
Last year on celeberation of successfull landing of changrayaan 3, I decided to make few structural changes in the plugin, so that new features can be easily developed.Today, I’m excited to announce that these changes have been successfully implemented. Here’s what’s new:

1. Implemented Telemetry & Crash Reporting 📊
2. Added test cases ✅
3. Refactored code 🔧

If you haven't tried this plugin yet, head over to VS Code -> Extensions -> search for "Flutter Color" -> Install and start using it! I’d love to hear your feedback.

# Upcoming Features

1. Enable users to convert color codes between various formats such as RGBA, HEX, RGB, ARGB, etc. For example, users can input a HEX code, and the plugin will convert it to the RGBA format.
2. \______________________________________________
